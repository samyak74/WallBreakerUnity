# WallBreakerUnity
A recreation of classic block breaking games like Arkanoid. A bat at the bottom of the screen
is used to bounce a ball of blocks above. These blocks disappear after one or more hits, and
there will be three block types of different color.

There will be background music, and sound effects for the ball bouncing, and for the blocks
breaking. Once all destructible blocks on the level are gone, you move onto the next level
without interruption of the music.
